      InstructLab is a model-agnostic open source AI project that facilitates
      contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).
      We are on a mission to let anyone shape generative
      AI by enabling contributed updates to existing
      LLMs in an accessible way. Our community welcomes all those who
      would like to help us enable everyone to shape
      the future of generative AI.

  - context: |
      There are many projects rapidly embracing
      and extending permissively licensed AI models,
      but they are faced with three main challenges:
      contribution to LLMs is not possible directly.
      They show up as forks, which forces consumers
      to choose a "best-fit" model that isn't easily extensible.
      Also, the forks are expensive for model
      creators to maintain.
      The ability to contribute ideas is limited
      by a lack of AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how
      to fork, train, and refine models to
      see their idea move forward. This is a high
      barrier to entry. There is no direct
      community governance or best practice around
      review, curation, and distribution of forked models.
      InstructLab is here to solve these problems.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are some challenges of contributing
          to or extending existing open LLMs?
        answer: |
          First, you cannot contribute directly,
          they show up as forks, which forces consumers
          to choose a "best-fit" model that isn't easily extensible.
          Secondly, the ability to contribute is
          limited by the lack of AI/ML expertise.
      - question: |
          What makes it hard to contribute changes to AI models?
        answer: |
          The lack of AI/ML expertise creates a high barrier to entry.
      - question: |
          What problems is Instructlab aiming to solve?

          There are many projects rapidly embracing and extending

      For folks getting started with all things
      InstructLab, it may be easiest for you
      to join one of our community meetings
      and speak with project maintainers
      and other InstructLab collaborators live.
      You can find details on all of our community meetings,
      including our open office hours each Thursday,
      in our detailed [Project Meetings documentation]
      (https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/Collaboration.md#project-meetings).
      Everyone is welcome and encouraged to
      attend if they will find value in joining.
      Please note that some meetings are recorded and the recordings
      [published in our project YouTube channel]
      (https:// www.youtube.com/@InstructLab/playlists).
      The meeting host will advise all attendees
      if the meeting is being recorded. If you
      prefer to join camera off or dial in via phone
      so as to not be actively recorded and/or you
      prefer not to be on camera during meetings, that is absolutely no
      problem.

      InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment
      tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs.)
      The "lab" in InstructLab stands for [**L**arge-Scale
      **A**lignment for Chat**B**ots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081).
      The InstructLab project is sponsored by Red Hat.
      InstructLab was originally created by engineers
      from Red Hat and IBM Research.
      The infrastructure used to regularly train models
      based on new contributions from the
      community is donated and maintained by IBM.
